# Odoo Design Excersice

This project is a **web mockup** built with **Bootstrap 4.6**, **SCSS**, and a focus on **desktop viewports (≥992px)**.  
It was created as part of a **technical interview assessment** to demonstrate skills in modern layout development, SCSS variable management, and project organization best practices.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **Bootstrap 4.6.x** – responsive grid system and components  
- **SCSS (Sassy CSS)** – variables, nesting, partials  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – minimal interactivity  
- **Git / GitHub** – version control

## Improvements

The mock-up presents a clean and modern layout with a strong hero section. However, I would refine the grid alignment in the cards section to ensure consistent spacing and a fully responsive layout, to create a more balanced and polished look.

I’d also experiment with a slightly more harmonious color palette, a Dark Mode toggle for better accessibility and visual comfort, and include a Language switcher to adapt the UI for bilingual users.

These changes would elevate the interface, more **interactive, dynamic, inclusive and user-centered experience**.
